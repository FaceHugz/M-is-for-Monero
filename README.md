# Mal-go:  Go-based  Monero simulation ( with C intergration) 

For educational purposes! LISTEN APES use of this script in the wild is likely to face legal action. In no way am I responsible for what you guys do with my project! 

Mal-go demonstrates a cross-language (Go + C) approach to building a simulated cryptominer for penetration testing, research, and malware development studies. The project shows how Go by itself cannot efficiently mine Monero (XMR), so it relies on a native C backend for actual mining logic.

- Cross-platform Go agent/loader
- C-based miner integration (memory-only execution)
- (Describe any other features: network scanning, self-update, persistence, etc.)

## Building

You'll need:
- Go (1.21+ recommended)
- gcc (for CGO to compile C code)
- (Any other dependencies)

Example build commands:
```sh
go build -o malgo main.go

AGAIN APES 

- **Be explicit about education and research** to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Do NOT post real wallets or pools.** Use dummy values.
- **No binaries!** Just source, unless it's a safe lab-only tool.
- **No installation instructions for infecting real devices.** Only testing/sim lab guidance.

## Features

- **Stealth WebSocket C2:** Encrypted command-and-control with optional TLS support.
- **AMSI & Defender Bypass:** In-memory obfuscation and syscall-based detection evasion.
- **Simulated Monero Mining:** Mining logic shown for researchâ€”**Go cannot mine Monero alone!** Real mining requires C backend (e.g., XMRig).
- **Encrypted/Obfuscated Config:** Pools, wallets, and C2 data are hidden at rest, decrypted at runtime.
- **Self-Update & Payload Loader:** Can auto-update or fetch new payloads for execution (memory-only or disk).
- **Persistence:** Supports Windows registry autorun persistence.
- **Anti-VM & Fingerprinting:** Collects system info, detects VMs, randomizes delays.
- **Memory-Only Execution:** In-memory loader/injector to avoid leaving disk artifacts.
- **Cross-Platform Go Framework:** Modular code, easily extended for research or testing.

I will also post a STAND-ALONE script for EternalBlue-Logic I will not post the other half which is the explotation using  shellcodes. If you need to test in lab, use Metasploit or Venom for payloads!
